Hi, Iâ€™m @Kiran2552004! Iâ€™m passionate about doing projects and am eager to gain practical experience through internships or work opportunities. Currently, Iâ€™m learning back-end and I completed Front-end and did some projects which you can see on my github profile. Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that allow me to grow and contribute effectively. If you're interested in working together or have any opportunities, feel free to reach out! ðŸ“« You can contact me at linkedIn. Pronouns: He.
